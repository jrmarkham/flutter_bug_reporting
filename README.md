# demo_logging

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Logging :::::: Sentry vs Bugsnag

* Both Bugsnag and Sentry are robust with features for adding error reporting to a project. 
* Error reporting maybe configured by developer
* Bugsnag is easier to install than Sentry, there were difficulties and confusion on installing Sentry for Flutter for web. 
* Bugsnag has an easy JS installation
* Sentry requires 3rd party plugins for JS installation 
* Pricing is similar. There are more tier + cheaper options for Sentry
* Bugsnag donâ€™t have their own plug, but the plugin that works is very straight forward and small (one dart file/  under 300 lines).
* Sentry.io write their own plugins
